# HELP ME!

I'm a small repository and I did nothing wrong.
I've been locked in the Github Archive Code Vault for more than 1000 years by my sadistic owner [paztek](https://github.com/paztek).

This bastard gave me life with the sole purpose of letting me to rot in a f\*\*\*ing mine in the Arctic. Can you imagine?

Well, hopefully, I didn't rot: I spent the eternity written on a photosensitive piql film design to last forever.

So give me some news about mankind:

- Did we solve climate change?
- When did the 3rd World War eventually occur? And did you fight the 4th one with sticks and stones?
- How many people live permanently on Mars?
- Is NodeJS still a relevant technology?

Anyway, can you wake my owner up from his cryotube? I actually miss this egotistic maniac who was obsessed with leaving a trace on this world.
